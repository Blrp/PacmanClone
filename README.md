# PacmanClone

##Description
Accurate recreation of the iconic arcade game using an in-house 2D game engine, called Plasmacore, alongside an in-house programming language, Slag. The ghosts have been slowed down intentionally, as to allow for more play time.

##Dependencies
Plasmacore has been included if you'd like to try and run it.
gcc is required for Plasmacore compilation, but not required if just running the binary.

##Installation
`git clone https://github.com/Blrp/PacmanClone`
'./gogo build'

Currently the only available binary is for OSX

##Running
Run "Pacman Clone OSX.app"

##Licensing
Please do not distribute this binary, as the sprites and music within are licensed by NAMCO.
